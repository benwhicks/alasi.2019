# Trace Data ALASI 2019 R Package

This is a collection of code for building the materials for the workshop on trace data, presented at the ALASI 2019 conference in Wollongong. 

All data is based on real student data, but remodelled, anonymised and scrambled so it bares little resemblance to the original data except that the results are in line with a student data set.
